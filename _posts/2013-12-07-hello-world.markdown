Many years ago, I had a blog. Not because I had anything to write but rather
to try out what the internet had to offer. The blog was soon forgotten, and with
time the wordpress installation deteriorated as can be expected. After it was 
shut down, it was rarely missed. 



Here I am again though. A brand new website with a brand new blog. I expect that
I will write about whatever strikes my fancy, most likely things regarding 
programming, computer culture or culture culture.



A little about me and this website: I am a 21 year old computer aficionado from
Stockholm, Sweden. I am currently studying Computer Science and Engineering
at the [Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm](http://kth.se).



This website is meant to serve as a personal website for me, as well as let me
keep a collection of my thoughts and other things I wish to share with the world.
