      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        I currently work as the CTO of <a href="https://insurely.com">Insurely</a>, a company building infrastructure and solutions in the open finance space. Previously I've worked in software engineering roles at <a href="https://tink.com">Tink</a> and <a href="https://yogobe.com">Yogobe</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hold a master's degree in computer science from <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a> in Stockholm. I lived a semester in Singapore and studied at the <a href="https://nus.edu.sg/">National University of Singapore</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I began my career with Flash ActionScript, building games and interactive ads for <a href="https://www.knassar.fo/">Knassar</a>.
        During the subsequent years I built various online communities of different sizes, mainly using PHP and MySQL.
        These were all self-hosted in a time before Docker was a thing.
        After this I was involved in, and for a while led, the part of the <a href="https://datasektionen.se">Computer Science chapter</a> that was responsible for building and maintaining the internal IT systems for the chapter.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love solving problems, and I am a big fan of simple solutions and well-made abstractions. I find Rich Hickey's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4"></a>Simple Made Easy</a> talk to be a great inspiration.
